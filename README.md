# C Programming

C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language that provides low-level access
to memory, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style that makes it ideal for systems
programming, embedded development, and learning core programming concepts.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites: a C compiler such as `gcc` (MinGW on Windows).

Compile and run an example (Windows / PowerShell): 
- VScode (code editer),
- Code::Blocks (IDE).

## Tips for programming.
    >.Document what you learn for easy recollection.
    >.Start Building your own project early based on what u learn.
    >.Practice Alorithms months before first interviews

## Style & Notes

- Keep functions small and focused.
- Use meaningful variable names and comment
